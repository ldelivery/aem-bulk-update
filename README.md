# aem-bulk-update
Postman collection to Bulk-Update AEM Meta Descriptions.

**Bonus:** We will generate the new meta descriptions with ChatGPT.

## Pre-Requisites
 * Download & Install Postman -> https://www.postman.com/downloads (MacOS, Windows, Linux)
 * Import postman.json into your local Postman instance

## Step 1 - Extract pages & properties from AEM
 * We are using the Query Builder API to get the pages and properties out of AEM [1]
 * This is the first of three requests in our postman.json
 * **Input**: You need to configure it with the AEM Author URL, User, Password and the Path you want to query
 * **Output**: You get CSV output on the postman console of the pages with the following properties: path,excerpt,name,title,lastModified,created -> Save this output to a file e.g. aem-pages.csv
 
 
## Step 2 - Transform page titles into meta descriptions using ChatGPT
 * ChatGPT will create the new descriptions for us, one by one using a Postman Runner.
 * This is the second of three requests in our postman.json
 * Open a Postman Runner (File -> New Runner Tab), Select your CSV file, Pull Step 2 ... into the runner and uncheck Step 1 & Step 3 in the "Run order" area. 
 * **Input**: CSV file from the previous request e.g. aem-pages.csv
 * **Output**: You get CSV output on the postman console of the pages with the properties: title, meta_description -> Save this output to a file e.g. aem-pages-new-meta-descriptions.csv


## Step 3 - Load new meta descriptions back into AEM
 * We send the new meta descriptions back to AEM using another Postman runner.
 * This is the third of three requests in our postman.json
 * Open a Postman Runner (File -> New Runner Tab), Select your CSV file, Pull Step 3 ... into the runner and uncheck Step 1 & Step 2 in the "Run order" area. 
 * **Input**: CSV file from the previous request. e.g. aem-pages-new-meta-descriptions.csv

##Â Final Check

That's it. The last thing to do ist to check on your AEM Author if your new meta descriptions have been updated properly on all the pages.
